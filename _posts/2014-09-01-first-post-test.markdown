Hello. My name is Jeff. 
Sex!
Did I catch your attention?  My instincts tell me that I need to capture my audience immediately in order to compete in the vast web of the blogosphere. My instincts also tell me that I shouldnâ€™t resort to cheap gimmicks to gain publicity. But I digress.

The intent of this blog is to provide you a concise perspective into tech-related things from a non-tech (read: amateur) person. This is hardly a unique premise. What I do plan to do, however, is to provide a consistent flow of content arranged in list-form (gasp! More sensationalist list media?) punctuated by a small unrelated tidbit at the end. My entries will aim to be bite-sized and try not to take up more than a few minutes of your day.

Be sure to visit back often. I hope to see you again! :)
