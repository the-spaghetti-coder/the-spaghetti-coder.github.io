**1. Add -ify as a suffix whenever possible**

Spotify. Chirpify. Shopify. Leadify. And my personal favorite (just from the way it looks), Srvify. I wonder, would I be the most tech-savvy of all companies if I founded my dream company, **Ifyify**? _We have double the technology power than all those other failure-ify companies. They only work with mono-core ify nodal jibjabbers. So you should buy our stock._ But I digress.

[Here’s](http://www.thenameinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/ify-chart.pdf) an infographic of various -ify company names. Maybe you’ll notice its exponential behavior starting in 2008. Where did this sudden influx of tech companies come from? Did they think that by simply appending a cutesy suffix to their name that we, as consumers, would instantly trust them to be on the cutting-edge of technology? Or did they just want to be trendy and fit in with the other cool kid companies? I guess the world will just have to wait and see until the next trendy suffix/prefix dominates company names.

**2. Use short and vague nouns that don’t make any sense**

What companies come to mind when you think of technology? Google? Amazon? Oracle? Apple?
These nouns, by themselves, do not really exemplify their company’s ability/function in the marketplace. _Hi, is this Google? Yes, I’d like to buy one extremely large number with some decimals on the side. No fractions. Thank you._

Just try to rationalize these tech giants' names. You can't. I suppose the stretch reason would be that they sought out short names in order to appease people that like bite-sized words. That's literally the only reason, and I would very much like to be corrected by some corporate company nomenclature consultant (you can find my e-mail in the footer).

**3. The true way to design a company name**

_Name it whatever you want_. Sure, company names can be catchy buzzwords that help with initial marketing and coolness factor, but company names don’t sell products. Quality does. 

Company names are only as memorable as they are because of the value of their product behind them. Essentially, if someone founded a cloud-based company named stormyWeather which offered the best cloud services in the history of ever, then stormyWeather would become just as household as Google or Amazon. The takeaway is this: build a great product, and you can name your tech company whatever you want. 

But what do I know? I've never even made a company (yet).
