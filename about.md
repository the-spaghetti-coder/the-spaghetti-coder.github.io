<strong>About this site:</strong>

The intent of this blog is to provide you a concise perspective into tech-related things from a non-tech (read: amateur) person. This is hardly a unique premise. What I do plan to do, however, is provide a consistent flow of content arranged in list-form (gasp! More sensationalist list media?) punctuated by a small unrelated tidbit at the end. My entries will aim to be bite-sized and try not to take up more than a few minutes of your day.

This blog was created using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

<strong>About me:</strong>

Hello! My name is Jeff. 
I’m an independent mobile developer whom works with both iOS and Android. I managed to publish a fairly silly nap-utility app which you can find [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cedideas.catnap) and am currently working on an iOS game. I graduated from U.C. Berkeley with the completely relevant degree of Integrative Biology (aka biology, but more liberal!). I’m on a journey to continually improve my skills/craft and consider myself able to learn anything given that I have enough foolish passion and drive to do so.
