I’m an independent mobile developer whom works with both iOS and Android. I managed to publish a fairly silly nap-utility app which you can find [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cedideas.catnap) and am currently working on an iOS game. I graduated from U.C. Berkeley with the completely relevant degree of Integrative Biology (aka biology, but more liberal!). I’m on a journey to continually improve my skills/craft and consider myself able to learn anything given that I have enough foolish passion and drive to do so.
